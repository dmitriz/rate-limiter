# Project Rules for Minimal Rate Limiter

## 1. Naming and Language

- Use plain, descriptive names (avoid jargon like "token", "bucket", "refill").
- All comments and docs must be understandable by beginners.

## 2. API Design

- Provide a functional wrapper (for example: `rateLimitWrap(fn, opts)`).
- Export only the minimal, most useful API.

## 3. Documentation

- README must explain what the limiter does, why, and how to use it.
- All examples must be runnable and match the actual API.
- Link to further reading (such as Wikipedia) for background.

## 4. Code Quality

- All code and markdown must be checked for errors and warnings before completion.
- Only include what is absolutely necessary for the core functionality.

## 5. Testing and Examples

- Provide at least one runnable example file.
- Tests and examples must use the exported API and be minimal.

## 6. Minimalism

- No unnecessary abstractions, dependencies, or configuration.
- Keep everything as short and clear as possible.
